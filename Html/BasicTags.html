<!-- The <html> tag defines the root of an HTML document. 
    It contains two sections: the <head> and the <body>.

The <head> tag contains information about the document, 
    such as its title, meta data, style sheets, scripts,
    etc. It is not visible to the user.

The <title> tag defines the title of the document, 
    which is displayed in the browserâ€™s tab or window. 
    It must be inside the <head> section.

The <body> tag defines the main content of the document, 
    which is visible to the user. It can contain text,
    images, links, tables, forms, etc.

The <h1> to <h6> tags define headings of different levels. 
    The <h1> tag defines the most important heading, 
    while the <h6> tag defines the least important one. 
    Headings are useful for organizing and structuring your web page.

The <p> tag defines a paragraph of text. Paragraphs are separated
    by a blank line or by a closing </p> tag.

The <br> tag defines a line break. It is an empty element, which
    means it does not need a closing tag. It can be used to create
    a new line within a paragraph or other elements.

The <hr> tag defines a horizontal line. It is also an empty element.
    It can be used to create a visual separation between sections of 
    your web page.

The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has an attribute called href,
    which specifies the URL of the linked document. You can use any 
    text or image as the link content.

The <img> tag defines an image. It has attributes such as src, 
    which specifies the source URL of the image; alt, which specifies 
    an alternative text for the image; width and height, which specify the 
    dimensions of the image in pixels. -->
