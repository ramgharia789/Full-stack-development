# Full Stack Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my Full Stack Development Learning Repository! This is where I document my journey as a self-learner in full-stack web development. I'll be using various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, Java, and MySQL, to build web applications and gain hands-on experience.

## My Learning Goals

- Gain proficiency in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Learn back-end development with Java and MySQL.
- Develop web applications from scratch.
- Create and deploy RESTful APIs.
- Explore best practices in full-stack development.

## Projects

Throughout my learning journey, I'll be working on a series of projects to apply what I've learned. Some of the projects I'll be tackling include:

- **Project 1:** Building a simple HTML/CSS webpage.
- **Project 2:** Developing an interactive JavaScript web application.
- **Project 3:** Implementing a RESTful API.
- **Project 4:** Building a Java-based web application.
- **Project 5:** Integrating a MySQL database.

## Repository Structure

- Each project has its own directory within this repository.
- README files in each project folder provide details, instructions, and code samples.
- The `src` directory contains source code for projects involving Java.
- The `css` and `js` directories store CSS and JavaScript files.

## Resources

As I progress in my learning journey, I'll be using various resources:

- Online tutorials and documentation.
- Books and courses.
- Coding exercises and challenges.
- Forums and community support.

## Contributing

While I'm primarily using this repository for personal learning, I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or insights from the community. If you notice any issues or have valuable insights to share, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/yourusername/full-stack-learning-repo/issues).

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to express my gratitude to the online development community, which has provided invaluable resources and support to learners like me. Special thanks to all the creators of tutorials, courses, and open-source projects that have contributed to my learning journey.

Happy coding, and thanks for joining me on my full-stack development adventure!
